# ## Problem Statement
# 
# Continuous slurry adsorption is carried out to reduce the pollutant content in an aqueous stream from an inlet concentration of 1x10$^{-2}$ mol l$^{-1}$ . The flowrate of the aqueous stream is 50 m$^3$ h$^{-1}$ . 
# The adsorbent flowrate is 750 kg h$^{-1}$. The residence time is 3 h. 
# 
# Adsorption is controlled by external mass transfer with a coefficient k$_L$= 0.5 m h$^{-1}$. 
# The adsorbent particles have a surface area of 10 m$^2$ kg$^{-1}$ and a density of 1850 kg m$^{-3}$.
# Consider a linear isotherm of the form $q=kc$, where $q$ [mol kg$^{-1}$] is the amount of phenol adsorbed per kg of adsorbent, $c$ is the molar concentration of pollutant in solution and $k=1\times{10}^4$ [l kg$^{-1}$] is the partition coefficient. 
# 
# Determine the steady state concentration of pollutant in the aqueous stream leaving the unit.
