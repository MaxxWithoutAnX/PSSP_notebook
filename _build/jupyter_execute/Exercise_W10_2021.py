## Problem Statement 

Consider a drying process evolving through two stages of _i_ constant drying rate, and _ii_ falling rate (first order kinetics). 

During stage _i_ the drying rate per unit area is constant, and indicated with $R_c=m\times{f_c}=const$. The the critical moisture content is indicated with $w_c$, and $w_0$ indicates initial moisture content. 

- Derive an expression for the time necessary to reduce the moisture content from $w_0$ to $w_c$. 

During stage _ii_ the rate of drying is constant, and proportional to the free moisture content. The falling rate regime stops at the rquilibrium moisture content $w_e$. 

- Derive an expression for the time necessary to reduce the moisture content from $w_c$ to $w_e$ in the (linear) falling regime.


If a system, characterised by critical moisture content of 18% and an equilibrium moisture content of 2% takes 7300 seconds to reach a final moisture content of 5% from an initial moistyure content of 20%, how long will it take, in the same conditions, to dry a system from 30% to 3%.
