    "\n",
    "A protein mixture has been separated through an ion-exchange chromatography process. The residence time of the column in non-adsorbing conditons is $t_0=1$ min.\n",
    "The chromatogram resulting from the separation is reported in the following: \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"./chromatogram.png\" alt=\"Drawing\" style=\"width: 600px;\">\n",
    "\n",
    "### Determine:\n",
    "- How many components in the mixture can you identify from the chromatogram?\n",
    "- What is the selectivity of this column for each couple of components? \n",
    "- Assuming a linear adsorption isotherm holds in all cases, what conclusions can you draw about adsorption thermodynamics of each component in the column?\n",
    "- What is the number of theoretical plates associated to the elution of each component you have identified? If the coulmn is 10 cm long, what is the height equivalent of a theoretical plate for each component of the mixture? \n",
    "- Compute the resolution relative to each couple of components in the chromatogram. Does it depend only on the adsorption thermodynamics?\n",
    "- Comment on the separation performances of the column. Does it allow for a sharp resolution of all components?\n"

    "### Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The chromatogram clearly indicates three components, let us indicate them with A, B, and C. \n",
    "The retention times for these components are: \n",
    "$t_{r,A}=7$ //\n",
    "$t_{r,B}=10$\n",
    "$t_{r,C}=15$\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The selectivity can be computed for every pair of components as: \n",
    "$$\n",
    "S_{i,j}=\\frac{t_{r,i}-t_0}{t_{r,j}-t_0}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Since $S_{i,j}=H_i/H_j$ we can determine the relative affinity of components A, B and C for the startionary phase. Component C shows the highest affinity for the stationary phase, followed by B and then C. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. The number of theoretical plates associated to the elution of components A, B, and C can be obtained applying the relationship $N=$\n",
