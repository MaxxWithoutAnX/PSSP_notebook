# Week 5 - Exercise

## Problem Statement

A protein mixture has been separated through an ion-exchange chromatography process. The residence time of the column in non-adsorbing conditons is $t_0=1$ min.
The chromatogram resulting from the separation is reported in the following:

### Determine:
- How many components in the mixture can you identify from the chromatogram?
- What is the selectivity of this column for each couple of components? 
- Assuming a linear adsorption isotherm holds in all cases, what conclusions can you draw about adsorption thermodynamics of each component in the column?
- What is the number of theoretical plates associated to the elution of each component you have identified? If the coulmn is 10 cm long, what is the height equivalent of a theoretical plate for each component of the mixture? 
- Compute the resolution relative to each couple of components in the chromatogram. Does it depend only on the adsorption thermodynamics?
- Comment on the separation performances of the column. Does it allow for a sharp resolution of all components?


### Solution

1. The chromatogram clearly indicates three components, let us indicate them with A, B, and C. 
The retention times for these components are: 
$t_{r,A}=7$ //
$t_{r,B}=10$
$t_{r,C}=15$

2. The selectivity can be computed for every pair of components as: 
$$
S_{i,j}=\frac{t_{r,i}-t_0}{t_{r,j}-t_0}
$$

3. Since $S_{i,j}=H_i/H_j$ we can determine the relative affinity of components A, B and C for the startionary phase. Component C shows the highest affinity for the stationary phase, followed by B and then C. 

4. The number of theoretical plates associated to the elution of components A, B, and C can be obtained applying the relationship $N=$
