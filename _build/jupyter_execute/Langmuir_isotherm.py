# # 5. The Langmuir Isotherm

# The Langmuir isotherm provides a relationship between the compositions of the fluid phase and of the adsorbed phase at equilibrium.
# 
# In the following we shall note with $C$ the concentration of the component that undergoes adsorption in the fluid phase, and with $q$ its  molar fraction in the adsorbed phase. 
# 
# The Langmuir isother is based on a set of assumptions:
# - The kinetic constants of the adsorption and the desorption processes, as well as the equilibrium constant for the adsorption process, are independent from the fraction of free adsorption sites.
# - Interactions between adsorbed molecules are neglibile, or in other words the adsorption process does not depend on the local environment around an adsorption site.
# - The surface of the adsorbent material can host a single monolayer of adsorbed molecules, hence its fraction of free sites $\theta_0$ and the fraction of occupied sites $\Gamma_1$ are related through the stoichiometric relation $\Gamma_0+\Gamma_1=1$.
# 
# In order to derive the langmuir adsorption isotherm from this set of hypotheses let's start by defining expressions for the adsorption and desorption rates. 
# 
# The adsorption process takes place when a molecule of the component that is undergoing adsorption finds a free adsorption site. The rate of an adsorption event can thus be considered analogous to a bimolecular elementary reaction step with rate:
# 
# $$
# R_A=k_A\Gamma_0{C}
# $$(LANGeq1)
# 
# Where $k_A$ is the kinetic constant, $\Gamma_0$ is the fraction of free adsorption sites,  and $x$ is the molar fraction of the adsorbing component in the fluid phase.
# 
# The rate of desorption instead can be considered analogous to a monomolecular reaction, in which a (non-covalent) bond is broken and an adsorbed molecule is released to the fluid phase, leaving one free site. Its rate can be written as: 
# 
# $$
# R_D=k_D\Gamma_1
# $$(LANGeq2)
# 
# At equilibrium, the rates of adsorption and desorption are equal and the net flux of molecules to and from the adsorbed phase is null. 
# We can thus write: 
# 
# $$
# k_A\Gamma_0{C}=k_D\Gamma_1
# $$(LANGeq3)
# 
# Recalling the stoichiometric relation between the fraction of accupied and free sites Eq. \eqref{eq:3} becomes: 
# 
# $$
# k_A(1-\Gamma_1){C}=k_D\Gamma_1
# $$(LANGeq4)
# 
# which can be rearranged to provide an explicit expression of $\Gamma_1$, the fraction of accupied sites, as a function of the concentration $C$ in the fluid phase: 
# 
# $$
# \Gamma_1=\frac{k_A{C}}{k_D+k_A{C}}
# $$(LANGeq5)
# 
# To obtain a typical expression of the Langmuir isotherm we shall introduce as a single parameter for this equation the adsorption equilibrium constant $B_0=k_A/k_D$: 
# 
# $$
# \Gamma_1=\frac{B_0{C}}{1+B_0{C}}
# $$(LANGeq6)
# 

# ## 5.1 Isotherm dependence on $B_0$

# In order to understand the role of the adsorption equilibrium constant let us plot the fraction of occupied adsorption sites as a function of $B_0$

# ## 5.2 Concentration in the adsorbed phase.

# The Langmuir isotherm as discussed so far provides a relationship between the fractional occupation of adsorption sites $\Gamma_1$ and the concentration in the fluid phase $C$. This relationship is only dependent on the thermodynamics of adsorption, captured by the value of the adsorption equilibrium coinstant $B_0$. In order to compute the concentration adsorbed by a specific material we need one additional parameter, the maximum concentration $q_M$ in the adsorbed phase. 
# The concentration in the adsorbed phase is thus computed as: $q=\Gamma_1{q_M}$, hence: 
# 
# $$
# q=q_M\frac{B_0{C}}{1+B_0{C}}
# $$(LANGeq7)
# 
# The parameter $q_M$ depends on the adsorbent material, and in particular on the amount of surface area per unit volume. 
# 
# In the following we report the concentration in the adsorbed phase, in equilibrium with an arbitrary concetration $C'$ in the fluid phase as a function of the affinity towards the stationary phase (captured by parameter $B_0$) and of its surface area (captured by parameter $q_M$).

# ## 5.3 Langmuir isotherm in the gas phase. 

# When describing the thermodynamics of adsorption from the gas phase it is convenient to introduce explicitly the pressure $P$ in the Langmuir isotherm. 
# In this case the expression of the monocomponent Langmuir isotherm becomes: 
# 
# $$
# q=q_M\frac{B_1{P}}{1+B_1{P}}
# $$(LANGeq8)
# 
# where $B_1=B_0/RT$ and $P$ is pressure.

# ## 5.4 Multicomponent, competitive adsorption
# 
# In multicomponent systems, in which $N$ components compete for the same adsorption sites we can define the adsorption equilibrium constant of component $i$ as: 
# 
# $$
# B_{1,i}=\frac{\Gamma_i}{P_i\Gamma_0}
# $$(LANGeq9)
# 
# In a multicomponent system, the single layer hypothesis bocomes: 
# 
# $$
# \Gamma_0+\sum_{i=1}^N{\Gamma_i}=1 
# $$(LANGeq10)
# 
# Substituting in Eq. {eq}`LANGeq10` the definition of adsorption equilibrium constant given in Eq. {eq}`LANGeq9` we get: 
# 
# $$
# \Gamma_0^{-1}=1+\sum_{i=1}^N{B_{1,i}P_i}
# $$(LANGeq11)
# 
# finally, substituting again $\Gamma_0^ {-1}$ in Eq. {eq}`LANGeq9`, and rearranging we get an expression of the fraction of sites occupied by specie $i$ as a function of the partial pressure (concentration) of $i$ in the fluid phase. 
# 
# $$
# \Gamma_i=\frac{B_{1,i}P_i}{1+\sum_{i=1}^NB_{1,i}{P_i}}
# $$(LANGeq12)
# 
# Finally, inserting the density of specie $i$ in the adsorbed phase we get: 
# 
# $$
# q_i=q_M\frac{B_{1,i}{P_i}}{1+\sum_{i=1}^NB_{1,i}{P_i}}
# $$(LANGeq13)
# 
# where $N$ is the total number of components, $P_i$ is the partial pressure component $i$ in the gas phase, and $B_{1,i}=B_{0,i}/RT$ where $B_{0,i}$ is the adsorption equilibrium constant for component $i$. 
# 
# In the following we report the competitive adsorption isotherms of two components adsorbing from a binary mixture.
