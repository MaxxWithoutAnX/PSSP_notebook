    "\n",
    "Water (density 1000 kg m$^{-3}$, viscosity 1 mN s m$^{-2}$) is used to fluidise a bed of packed spheres characterised by a diameter of 0.5 mm and a density of 1500 kg m$^{-3}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tasks\n",
    "- Demonstrate that, in laminar regime, the minimum fluidization velocity is alway smaller than the terminal falling velocity. \n",
    "- Compute the minimum fluidisation velocity and the terminal falling velocity of the bed particles.\n",
    "- Sketch a plot of the $\\Delta{P}$ as a function of the fluid velocity, clearly indicating the minimum fluidisation velocity.\n",
    "- How would your result change if particles were twice as large?\n",
    "- What does the terminal falling velocity represent in the context of fluidisation? "

    "Cd=\\frac{24}{Re_p}=\\frac{24\\mu}{\\rho_fdv}\n",
