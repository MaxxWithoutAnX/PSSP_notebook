# Week 11 - Exercise

## Problem Statement

Water (density 1000 kg m-3, viscosity 1 mN s m-2) is used to fluidise a bed of packed spheres characterised by a diameter of 0.5 mm and a density of 1500 kg m-3.

### Tasks
- Demonstrate that, in laminar regime, the minimum fluidization velocity is alway smaller than the terminal falling velocity. 
- Compute the minimum fluidisation velocity and the terminal falling velocity of the bed particles.
- Sketch a plot of the $\Delta{P}$ as a function of the fluid velocity, clearly indicating the minimum fluidisation velocity.
- How would your result change if particles were twice as large?
- What does the terminal falling velocity represent in the context of fluidisation?
